core-doc-viewer
================

**This element is compatible with Polymer 0.5 and lower only, and will be deprecated.**  
You can check out a similar 0.8-compatible version of this element at [https://github.com/polymerelements/iron-doc-viewer](https://github.com/polymerelements/iron-doc-viewer)

See the [component page](https://www.polymer-project.org/0.5/docs/elements/core-doc-viewer.html) for more information.


**Note** If you update elements in this repo, you'll need to rebuild `build.sh` in [core-component-page-dev](https://github.com/Polymer/core-component-page-dev) so they're used in the compiled version (core-component-page).
